##  Data Protection

"At REFUNITE, we strongly believe that the user is the best judge as to the amount of information they share"

note:
  So I'm going to talk about different areas of safety which should all be considered the first is Data Protection

  Marginalised people might be targeted for offline harassment, harnessers will collect information from different public sources and stolen data and combine it to find out where somebody lives, works, their phone number, their friends. So we should limit how much data we collect to decrease the risk

  A quote from REFUNITE the refugee reconnection platform
  "At REFUNITE, we strongly believe that the user is the best judge as to the amount of information they share" 

  This is a useful way to start to think about data protection

  Give the user control of the information they share, communicating the way you'll use that information, the dangers of sharing the information and the option to delete information. This will help protect user.

  I like the way REFUNITE make providing all information optional and encourage the use of pet names and data which will only be known to close friends and family rather than forcing the user to share as much information as possible. They try to collect enough information to achieve their goal but avoid collecting excessive data, this is best practise.
