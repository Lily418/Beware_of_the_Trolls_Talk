##  How to think about needs of users?

- Build a diverse team
- User focused design
- Make considering safety a step in your design process
note:
  When trying to build applications for marginalised people you won't get far unless your team includes people from marginalised groups, if someone has never experienced harassment online they are unlikely to consider it when making design decisions and it can be small decisions which make a big difference

  Ugly Mugs the app to help protect sex workers uses a black background to avoid the phone doesn't light up sex workers' faces and draw attention. This is an example of user focused design where the needs of the user have been carefully considered. 

  We should try to make considering user safety a part of every stage of our design process, for every feature and piece of data collected we should ask "How will this affect the safety of our users?"
