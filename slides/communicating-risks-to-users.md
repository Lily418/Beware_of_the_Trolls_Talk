##  Communicating Risks to Users

Please be careful about arranging meetings with people you don't know, and be careful about posting anything that might reveal your identity."](resources/grindr-egypt.jpg)
note:
  I believe it's important to be realistic that no technical solution will be flawless and social engineering is always a possibility so it's important to communicate to users the risks of using the platform. 

  Grindr displays this message to its users in Egypt "Egypt is arresting LGBT people, and police may be posing as LGBT on social medial to entrap you. Please be careful about arranging meetings with people you don't know, and be careful about posting anything that might reveal your identity."

  You need to clearly communicate risks to your users and be sure to use language which is accessible to users who may know less about how technology works
