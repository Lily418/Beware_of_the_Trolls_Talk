##  Security

- Two Factor Authentication  
- End to end encryption
- Do you really need to store unencrypted data?
- Does is need to be online? 
- Avoid creating a false sense of security

note:
  Security is always important but it becomes even more important when trying to protect marginalised users. 

  Two Factor authentication is when you require at least two ways for the user to prove their identity so they can log in, this could be a password and a code you text to their mobile phone. You could support this and encourage your users to set it up for their accounts.

  WhatsApp uses end to end encryption which means messages are transferred securely and they are stored in an encrypted form on their servers, this can be useful to protect journalists from government spying but they can still see who is communicating which might be sensitive information in itself. 

  Ask does it need to be online? WhatsApp uses end to end encryption because they don't need to be able to read the contents of user's messages to be able to deliver them, if you store unencrypted data it is a good idea to ask why you need access to the data and if there would be an alternative for example you might be able to process the data locally on the user's device and avoid storing the data on your servers.

  Avoid creating a false sense of security, for example if your platform is for people from a criminalised group it would be unethical to claim it is safe from government spying if you don't have a high sense of confidence that it is. There will be some situations in which a 3rd party security audit is required. You have a duty to protect your users.
