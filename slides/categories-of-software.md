##  Categories of Software  

- For everyone (Twitter, Tumblr)
- For a marginalised group (Refunite)
- For a criminalised group (Ugly Mugs, Grindr in countries where homosexuality is illegal)

note:
  Different software is going to need different types of protection in place for their users but these are some broad categories so we can start to think about the level of protection our users might need.

  A lot of software is built 'for everyone', I've used the example of Twitter because their platform has somewhat of a problem with harassment so I'd like to talk about the steps they're taking to combat it. We should always aim for any application we build to be welcoming to marginalised people so it's important to think about user safety when building any application. 

  We might like to build software which is specifically built to benefit a marginalised community, here we have additional challenges because the user base might be specifically targeted for harassment, we also have a heightened responsibility to protect the data of our users. The example I've chosen is Refunite which is a tool for refugees to reconnect refugee families which have been displaced, they have the specific challenge to protect users from being targeted by groups they are trying to escape.

  Our applications may also be used by groups which are criminalised for example Ugly Mugs which is an application to help protect sex workers and Grindr in countries where homosexuality is illegal. Here we may need to take steps to prevent our users from being targeted by government agencies
